# capacitor-plugin-camera

A Capacitor camera plugin.

It uses `getUserMedia`, `CameraX` and `AVFoundation` to access cameras on Web, Android and iOS respectively.

Working in progress.

For now, you can use the [Dynamsoft Camera Preview](https://github.com/tony-xlh/capacitor-plugin-camera-preview).

## Install
